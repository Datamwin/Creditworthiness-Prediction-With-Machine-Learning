# Loan-Eligibility-Project-With-Machine-Learning
Predicting Loan Eligibility of Applicants
### Project Objectives
In this project, different **Machine Learning Models** are built and the best is selected to assist a bank that has received loan applications
than it typically receives, predict applicants who are eligible (Creditworthy) for the loan and those that are not.

Besides the prediction, the management team wants to know important features used  by the model for further decisons.
