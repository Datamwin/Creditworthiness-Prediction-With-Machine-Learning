# Creditworthiness-Prediction-With-Machine-Learning
Predicting whether an applicant is credit-worthy or not.
### Project Objectives
In this project, different **Machine Learning Models** are built and the best is selected to assist a bank that has received more loan applications
than it typically receives; predict applicants who are eligible (Creditworthy) for the loan and those who are not.

Besides the prediction, the management team wants to know important features used  by the model for further decisions.

### Project Phases
1. Data importation

2. Exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and Feature engineering

3. Data preprocessing for modelling

4. Building different Classification models
5. Model Evaluation

6. Model selection

7. Feature importance

8. Summary
